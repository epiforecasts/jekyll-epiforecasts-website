## Using real-time modelling to inform the response to a diphtheria outbreak

On 10th November, 2017, a suspected case of diphtheria was reported at a Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) clinic in Cox’s Bazar district, Bangladesh. A bacterial infection, diphtheria was a major cause of childhood illness and death in the early 20th Century, before a vaccine was developed in the 1920s, then included in the WHO’s Expanded Programme on Immunization in the 1970s. In the following decades cases dropped dramatically, to the point where the disease was rarely seen in many countries. Between 2004 and 2017, there were only two diphtheria cases in the United States.

Unfortunately, diphtheria outbreaks can still occur in places that have conditions like low vaccination coverage, reduced access to healthcare, limited access to water and sanitation, and high population density. In late 2017, one such place was a cluster of several large refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar district at the southeastern tip of Bangladesh. Between August and December 2017, over 625,000 ethnic Rohingya had fled into the area from neighbouring Myanmar, settling in makeshift camps.

The site would become the world’s largest refugee camp, with evidence that there had been a long-term lack of healthcare access among these individuals. According to one survey performed by MSF in November 2017, less than a quarter of the children in the camps aged between 6 months and 5 years had been vaccinated against measles.
