## The gist 
We are a team based at [London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) who focus on real-time modelling and forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. We are funded by the Wellcome Trust and work in collaboration with a number of other research groups, public health agencies and NGOs. Our main aim is to develop forecasting methodology that makes the most of available resources to provide insights useful for outbreak response, control and prevention.
