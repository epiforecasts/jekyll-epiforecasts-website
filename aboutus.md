## The gist 
We are a team based at the [London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine](https://www.lshtm.ac.uk) who focus on real-time modelling and forecasting of infectious disease outbreaks. We are funded by the Wellcome Trust and work in collaboration with a number of other research groups, public health agencies and non-governmental organisation. Our main aim is to develop and use modelling methodology that makes the most of available resources to provide insights useful for outbreak response, control and prevention.
